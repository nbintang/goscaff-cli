# Fiber Opinionated Boilerplate

## Project Description
This repository provides a production-ready backend boilerplate for building RESTful APIs and microservices in Go. It combines Fiber for fast HTTP handling, Uber Fx for dependency injection, and GORM for database access to deliver a modular architecture that scales from small services to larger SaaS backends.

**Problems it solves**
- Eliminates repetitive setup for configuration, dependency wiring, and routing.
- Provides a consistent module pattern for features such as auth and user management.
- Bakes in infrastructure wiring (database, Redis, email, token handling) so teams can focus on business logic.

**Target use cases**
- Public APIs and internal microservices
- SaaS backends with authentication/authorization needs
- Rapid prototyping for Go/Fiber services

## Key Features
- **Modular architecture with Fx** for clear dependency boundaries and lifecycle management.
- **Fiber v2** for high-performance HTTP routing and middleware.
- **GORM + PostgreSQL** with migration and seeding entry points.
- **Redis cache + throttling** utilities via Fiber storage adapters.
- **JWT-based auth flows** and role-based access control scaffolding.
- **Centralized configuration** with Viper and environment validation.
- **Structured logging** using Logrus.
- **Standardized API responses** with pagination metadata and validation error details.
- **Request metadata middleware** for richer error payloads and logs.
- **Security & scalability considerations**
  - JWT access/refresh secrets and token verification services.
  - Middleware layering for access control and request metadata.
  - Stateless services with Redis-backed cache and blacklist checks.

### Folder responsibilities
- **cmd/**: Entry points that bootstrap the application (API server, migrations, seeding). Each command sets up configuration and executes its workflow.
- **config/**: Environment loading and validation. Defines the `Env` struct and Fx module setup for config binding.
- **internal/**: Core application logic. Feature modules live here and are wired together using Fx.
  - **auth/** and **user/**: Example domain modules demonstrating handlers, services, DTOs, repositories, and routes.
  - **http/**: Router contracts, middleware (JWT, role checks, request metadata), and error handling.
  - **infra/**: Infrastructure services (database, Redis cache, token service, validators, logging).
- **pkg/**: Reusable utility packages shared across modules (pagination, password hashing, HTTP response helpers, slice utilities).
- **e2e/**: End-to-end and integration tests. Covers real application flows across HTTP, database, and external dependencies.
- **docs/**: Project documentation and technical references. Used to document architecture, workflows, environment setup, and deployment notes.
- **scripts/**: Helper scripts for development and operational tasks. Contains automation scripts for migrations, seeding, database resets, and local workflows.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+
- PostgreSQL (or a compatible database)
- Redis (optional but required for cache/blacklist features)
- Make (optional but convenient)

### Environment configuration
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
2. Fill in database, Redis, JWT, and SMTP credentials as needed.
3. The configuration loader reads `.env.local` when `APP_ENV=development`, otherwise it falls back to `.env`.

### Run locally
```bash
make dev
```

### Migrations and seeding
```bash
make migrate
make seed
```

### Build and Clean build
```bash
make build
make clean
```

## API Documentation
- Base URL: `/api/v1`
- Protected routes: `/api/v1/protected` (Bearer access token required)
- Auth endpoints are throttled; refresh tokens are stored in an httpOnly cookie.
- Full endpoint list and request/response examples: `docs/api.md`

## Best Practices
- **Follow the module pattern**: Each feature module should expose its own `Module` that provides handlers, services, repositories, and routes.
- **Register new modules in `internal/feature_modules.go`** to keep the Fx wiring centralized.
- **Keep DTOs and entities separate**: Use DTOs for request/response shapes and entities for persistence models.
- **Lean middleware**: Put cross-cutting concerns in `internal/http/middleware` and keep handlers thin.
- **Prefer shared helpers in `pkg/`**: Pagination, hashing, and response formatting should be reused rather than duplicated.
- **Environment-driven configuration**: Never hardcode secrets; always use the `Env` struct and `.env` files.

## Extending the Boilerplate
1. Create a new module folder under `internal/` (e.g., `internal/order`).
2. Add domain layers (entity, repository, service, handler, route).
3. Implement a `Module` that provides dependencies and registers routes.
4. Add the module to `internal/feature_modules.go`.

---
This boilerplate is intentionally opinionated to encourage clean separation of concerns and scalable growth for production services.
